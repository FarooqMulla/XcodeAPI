    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Xcode has an unofficial plugin architecture that allows for the extension of the development environment, allowing features like source control management, platform integration, and linguistic definitions. Apple has not made any effort to make this API set published, this project is an effort to document and build a library of headers to be usable for the creation of plugins to customize your IDE. Of course some of these features may be subject to change since they are not supported by Apple, however a good faith effort will be made to maintain the documentation to the most current versions of Xcode.</p>
    
    <p>Development for Xcode can be done in three distinct routes; Cocoa plugins, plist specifications, and XML based plugins. Each of which have differing implementation capabilities and can offer certain development advantages over another. All documentation for these plugin creation methods are trial based extraction of information. The plist and xml based implementations are readily available within the plugins and specification folders in the Xcode install. Any Cocoa based headers can be easily created by utilizing <a href="http://www.codethecode.com/projects/class-dump/">class-dump</a></p>
